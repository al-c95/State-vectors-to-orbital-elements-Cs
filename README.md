Description
-----------
State vectors and Keplerian orbital elements are two main ways of uniquely describing a particular orbit, and predicting future motion.
State vectors are sets of numbers in Cartesian space, describing position and velocity. Keplerian elements are a set of numbers and angles
describing the ellipse which the orbit forms. This application is designed to convert from the former to the latter.

Requirements
------------
.NET Framework 4.6.1
Windows 7 SP1 or later
